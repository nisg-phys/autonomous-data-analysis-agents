# Autonomous Multi-Agent Data Analysis System (LangGraph + LLM + Evaluation)

A **production-grade autonomous AI system** that performs **end-to-end data analysis using multiple specialized agents**, orchestrated via **LangGraph**, and equipped with **self-evaluation and validation capabilities**.

This system automatically:
- Analyzes raw datasets
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains machine learning models using scikit learn library
- Interprets results using an LLM
- Evaluates system performance and reliability

> 🚀 This project demonstrates **agentic AI system design**, **graph-based orchestration**, and **self-evaluating ML pipelines**.
